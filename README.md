Q1.Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.

TCP/IP becomes the standard protocol of the internet at the beginning of the 80's. Many well known DNS naming standards are soon established after such as: .com, .gov, .edu. Towards the end of the 80's there is approximately 20'000 hosts. During 1990 Tim Berners-Lee develops HTML and shortly after the internet is introduced to the public. Micosoft creates a web browser, and shortly after the predecessor to Yahoo is formed. The Google search engine comes in to being shortly before the end of the 20th century. Soon after the internet explodes in users and usages. In 2004 FaceBook is released and ruins the world forever. By 2009 the internet is now 40 years old. 
Cut to today, your phone now talks to you and listens to everything you say. Creepy.


Q2.Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.

All of the content that can be found on the internet is stored in databases known as web servers. These can be thought of as a large grouping of computers to store and transmit data. On the other side of the spectrum is the web browser which is what the end user interacts with to access internet content. In order to store information efficiently and in an orderly matter, domains were created to link similair web pages together, e.g. ebay.com and then all of the ebay pages that then spring from there. Domain Name Servers convert IP addresses to readable and memorable domain names. A user accesses a web browser and searches for a domain name,the DNS translates the domain name to direct them towards the relevant web server.



Q3.Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.

Probably the most powerful contribution of the internet has been it's ability to provide vast informative resources to practically anyone. This has and will continue to bridge the education gaps between all world citizens and has allowed rapid learning of many skills and schools of thought. It also serves to bring us all closer together in understanding and tolerance. The introduction of free and essentially limitless information has limitless potential.
